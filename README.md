## About this project

In this repository you will find my progress in making the animelist app. Before you get started you have to come up with job stories. From your job stories you can look at which feature you are going to build. 
I have chosen several features namely:
* Adding an anime
* Deleting an anime
* Updating an anime
* Filter
* Register
* Liking

I have added two API to enhance the user experience, drag & drop and fetching quotes. Later in this project we are going to collaborate to add other functions and make a complete functioning  app. You can find my progress in my [wiki](https://github.com/davidsd29/Anime-list/wiki)
